# Why I’m Building WordPress Plugins (and What Comes Next)

I’ve spent the last few years working in enterprise .NET—scaling backend systems, navigating legacy codebases, and delivering production-ready features under pressure. It was solid work. It taught me discipline. But at some point, it stopped feeling like growth.

So I’m shifting gears.

I’m learning WordPress plugin development—not because I’m switching stacks, but because I’m exploring the foundations of a system that powers a huge chunk of the internet.  
More importantly, I’m targeting the kind of work culture I haven’t found in .NET spaces yet.

Automattic stood out for one reason: they’ve built the kind of environment I want to be part of—remote-first, async, open-source, and trust-driven.

If I want to contribute there, I need to speak the language.  
This is how I start doing that.

I’m not leaving what I know behind.  
I’m building on top of it—with purpose this time.
