# Recalibration Prep – Talha Amjad

This repo documents my shift toward async-first, open-source-friendly companies like Automattic—teams that value deep work, written clarity, and shipping real things that last.

I'm coming from an enterprise .NET background—backend systems, legacy refactoring, and pressure-tested feature delivery. Now I’m learning how to operate in open ecosystems like WordPress, starting with plugin dev from the ground up.

## Sections

- [`/plugin-dev`](./plugin-dev): Custom WordPress plugins built from scratch
- [`/writing`](./writing): Dev logs, reflections, and async-style blog posts
~~- [`/system-design`](./system-design): Future backend breakdowns and design exercises~~

## Why this repo exists

Because potential is nothing without proof.  
This is where I’m building mine—publicly, clearly, and on my own terms.
