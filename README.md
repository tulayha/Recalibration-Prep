# Recalibration Prep – Talha Amjad


This repo documents my journey preparing for opportunities at companies like Automattic—teams that value async collaboration, deep work, written clarity, and shipping real things that last.

I’m coming from a background in enterprise .NET, where I’ve worked across backend systems, legacy refactoring, and feature delivery under pressure. Now I’m learning how to operate in open ecosystems like WordPress—starting with plugin development from the ground up.

## Sections

- [`/plugin-dev`](./plugin-dev): Custom WordPress plugins I’m building from scratch
- [`/writing`](./writing): Dev logs, reflections, and async-style blog posts
- [`/system-design`](./system-design): Future breakdowns and backend design thought exercises

## Why this repo exists

Because potential is nothing without proof.  
And this is where I’m building mine—publicly, clearly, and on my own terms.
